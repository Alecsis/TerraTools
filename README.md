# TerraTools

This repository holds my tools that help me work on CosmWasm and Terra blockchains.

- [starter](starter.ipynb): python notebook that wraps `terra_sdk.py`, and proposes a framework to initialize and interact with contracts. Why ? I like python üêç
- [schema to class](cosmwasm_schema_parser/schema_to_class.py): it's quite long to write all the classes before starting to work, so I made my job easier with this. A little rusty and manual, but it does the job.
